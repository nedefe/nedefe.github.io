<h2> Who am I? <h2>

Iâ€™m currently working in the financial services industry in Melbourne, after having finished studying at the University of Melbourne (Bachelor of Commerce, Economics and Finance).

<h2> Why does this blog exist? <h2>

I suffer from the problem of being interested in many different things; a non-exhaustive list includes machine learning and computer vision, ecological systems, statistics and risk management, trading, and evolutionary biology. Notwithstanding the enjoyment I may receive from indulging my interest in the above subjects, there comes a time where one must engage in a more unified course of action to avoid drifting aimlessly between disparate goals. If anything, this blog is an attempt to do just that.

The more general point to make is that active and creative learning does a far better job at maximising for randomness and optionality (in knowledge, skills, and opportunities) than passive or content-based learning. Such a learning style need not even impose an additional time or resource constraint; given that one's primarty focus is on tinkering and implementation (e.g. doing projects, making things), it's not necessary to absorb all of the detail and content that one comes across in order to produce something or develop deeper understanding. Unlike traditional education, there is no future exam to prevent you from focusing on what actually matters and what you want to learn, as opposed to what you have to learn. The real test, rather, is in being able to do/create/write/produce something real.

On a conceptual level though, what does it mean to do something well? 
* One must be on-risk; that is to say that one's reputation must be on the line, and there must be a high degree of transparency and visibility in the output that is produced
* One must be able and willing to receive feedback and other such reciprocal stimuli
* Crucially, one must face a potential loss (in either a real or personal sense) greater than the opportunity cost of one's time for doing something wrong; this is a necessary condition for a selection effect (on onbe's own knowledge/skill) to occur. Thereby, don't do projects that can't fail in an obvious way (e.g. producing forecasts, writing subjective articles, and summarising content don't really count), and aim to showcase those projects that you do complete
* To increase the rate of doing things well through time (i.e. generalise with a derivation of the individual instance), one can increase either the depth or frequency of doing things well; the important thing to focus on is improving your _rate of change_ of doing either of these things (this will be the subject of a future post) 
* Lastly, while one should optimise (which, most of the time, is to increase) the effect of potential costs incurred for doing something wrong (thereby increasing selection/learning), one must **_not_** subject oneself to the risk of ruin; to use a trading analogy, avoid being exposed to bankruptcy or blowing up your P&L (i.e. your progress/life is a non-ergodic time average, not an ensemble average!)

However, it's difficult to be aware of the payoff, timing, probability density, and specific form (i.e. what it actually looks like) of the optionality produced by taking action. In essence, we pay some premium (today) in effort/opportunity cost to receive some potential future payoff, while knowing very little about what they payoff will be. Moreover, these options can interact in a potentially exponential or non-intuitive way; it may be the case that a single additional unit of premium paid corresponds to a regime shift in one's payoff (either realised or yet to be received). Thereby, the time path of progress is akin to a non-linear, dynamic system, with a variable degree of sensitivity (based on your rate of change, as discussed above) exogenous shocks. This is (almost) a complete antithesis to the process of learning within a traditional educational institution, and to the generic advice we tend to receive on how to go about planning our own lives!

From the point of view of empiricism, this approach likely doesn't make sense. Any data is clearly biased by observation (given that the observation itself is the data we care about), and we have no sound statistical methodology to draw inferences from groups/events/individuals with isolated exposure. Even if we could observe such data, it would still be virtually impossible to make predictions, as any parameters would likely lack a reasonable distribution or methodology for specification, and we have no means of accounting for the destabilising effect of randomness. This is what happens in non-linear, dynamic systems (such as turbulence, or ecology); we might be able to understand the general form, shape, or behaviour of the system, but we have no way of knowing or predicting exactly how it will behave, or what outcome it will produce. 

Thus, for effective and active learning, one must think in systems (rather than cause and effect), and one must embrace the power and leverage of randomness. The glue (cue drumroll) holding all of this together is a __general, principled, need I say faith-based belief__ in the validity of this view and these ideas. How does this reconcile with empiricism (and the other foundational tenents of Western philosophy, such as evidence, rationalism, and a default position of doubt in the absence of knowledge)? The most plausible, and in my view also most interesting answer to this, is that it doesn't. Clearly, a more flexible and robust epistemology is needed. This is especially the case for someone with a strong bend towards skepticism and extremely high in openness ([Big-5 Personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)), such as myself, who may not have a natural proclivity for conviction in principled, non-empirical ideas. 

Encountered with such ideas in the past, my gut reaction would have been "but how do you know? How can you know?"; the truth of the matter is that either you can't, or you need to change your understanding of what it is to know. 

In this case, do we know, or do we believe? I'll leave that for you, mighty reader, to consider.
